# RestorApp - Documentation App

This is a Flutter project.

It's homework for my Mobile Computing course @ my BSc Computer Science degree.

I will add more notes to this Readme + instructions on how to run this project as I continue development.

## Figma

I have the following Figma files that I've been using to organise myself during the development process.

- [A components library](https://www.figma.com/file/TMaXIRGYD8QId9YgPLj1eT/RestorApp-Library?node-id=0%3A1)
- [Design of the documentation app](https://www.figma.com/file/VdN5HkgOpmFBTXEfkkOA28/Documentation-App?node-id=6%3A5)
